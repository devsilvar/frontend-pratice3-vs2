## My process
started with the html
linked it to the css
the resulting page was loaded to the DOM with javascript since it is a web app

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanila Javascript


### What I learned

well i still have to refactor these code since they are not resusable so i am working on that, but for now. i learned how to carry out some actions before a click result is executed

How to load html codes from javascript


### Continued development
i will look for ways to redice the code to improve the perfromance of the page, but then it works very fine on all screen size
Refactoring is in porgress and will be updated soon

### Useful resources

- [Bro Code Youtube chnannel] - This helped me set timeout before executing a click action using his tutorial 
- i was able to correct the mistakes while making the codes shorter and faster
